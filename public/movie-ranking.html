<h1>The Best Movies According to Tim Skrinak</h1>

<h2>These are my top 3 favorite Movies of all time</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>The Santa Clause</h3>
<p>This is a fun movie that is always fun to watch at christmas time. I also enjoy Tim Allan as an actor.</p>

<h3>Mufasa</h3>
<p>This is a recent movie I saw with Jess and I fell in love with the digitally created lion that would become Simbas father.</p>

<h3>Live Free or Die Hard</h3>
<p>This is a great action movie that also includes some IT components, such as a fire sale.</p>
